# Colour Changer App

This project consists of two JavaScript files (`app.js` and `hex.js`) that demonstrate how to create a simple colour changer app. The app allows users to click a button and change the background color of the page to either a predefined set of colors or a randomly generated hex color code.

## Usage

To use the color changer app, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. You will see a "Click me" button in the middle of the page.
4. Click the button to see the background color change using either predefined colors or randomly generated hex codes.
